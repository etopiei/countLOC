# countLOC
A quick python script to count the lines of code in a project, written on a whim.
To use simply call the script from the command line eg:

> python projectLOC.py /project1

It will output the lines of code within the folder and all sub-folders.

Please note: This script will only count files with extensions listed in the .py file.
If you wish to count other files, or exclude some just edit the allowableExtensions to suit your needs.

This was created for personal use, and is not fully fleshed out. If you wish to modify or use it though feel free.
